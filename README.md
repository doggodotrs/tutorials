* Series 01 (2023-09): Rust for Absolute Beginners
---
## Project Description

The Rust Programming Language is a relatively new programming language, that is a modern, memory-safe alternative to C and C++.

I share my educational videos on YouTube to help make Rust more accessible for a global community of students, educators, hobbyists and professionals.

I share all of my code on GitHub, so everyone has free access to my code.
