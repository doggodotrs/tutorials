* Series 01 (2023-09): Rust for Absolute Beginners
---
## Project Description

The Rust Programming Language is a relatively new programming language, that is a modern, memory-safe alternative to C and C++.

I share my educational videos on YouTube to help make Rust more accessible for a global community of students, educators, hobbyists and professionals.

I share all of my code on GitHub, so everyone has free access to my code.

### How to support this project

The "doggo dot rs" YouTube channel is not monetized, so I'm not making any money from those videos.

However, if you watched any of the videos in my collection and found them to be helpful, then please consider making a donation to help offset some of the expenses that were required to produce those videos.

I am funding my YouTube channels from my personal savings and from the generosity of donors like you.

I thank you, in advance, for your consideration!

The best way to support these videos financially is by making a donation via my Liberapay account using this link:
